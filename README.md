# Example C# Cryptographic License Files

This is an example of how to verify and decrypt cryptographic license files in C#
and .NET, using Ed25519 and AES-256-GCM.

## Running the example

First, install dependencies with [`dotnet`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet):

```
dotnet restore
```

Then run the program:

```
dotnet run --path examples/license.lic \
  --key AFCC0A-B8C07F-F77E6C-93FB02-9FC515-V3
```

You should see log output indicating the current license file is valid as well
as its decrypted contents:

```
License file is valid! Decrypting...
License file was successfully decrypted!
Decrypted: ...
```
